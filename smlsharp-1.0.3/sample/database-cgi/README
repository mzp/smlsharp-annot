Sample application using database.

This program is a simple Web application with database.

This program requires the following systems:
- PostgreSQL
- An Web server supporting CGI (such as Apache)

How to run this demo:

(1) Create database "dbsample" on PostgreSQL.

(2) Run createtable.sql on PostgreSQL in order to set up tables and users.

(3) If needed, rewrite server description of '_sqlserver' at the beginning
    of pages.sml.

(4) Compile the program and put the resulting executable to the directory
    which is permitted to execute CGI programs.

(5) Access to the executable by your Web browser.
    If URL of your program is
      http://hostname/dbsample.cgi
    then you should access to
      http://hostname/dbsample.cgi/

Example:

(1)
  $ createdb dbsample
(2)
  $ psql -d dbsample -f createtable.sql
(4)
  $ make
  $ ./database-cgi
(5)
  $ w3m http://localhost/dbsample.cgi/
