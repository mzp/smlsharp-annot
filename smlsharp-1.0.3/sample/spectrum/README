Sound Spectrum

This is an example program using FFI.

This program reads raw sound data from standard input by fread(3),
calculates its power spectrum by FFT function of GSL library,
and displays it graphically in real time by using either curses or
OpenGL.

This demo requires the following libraries:

- GNU Scientific Library (libgsl)
- libcurses or OpenGL (libgl, libglu, libglut)

How to run this demo:

1. Prepare raw sound stream (44100Hz, signed 16 bit, stereo) by using
   mpg123, mplayer, sox or any other your favorite tool.
   If you don't have any tools, use "sine.c", which is a sine wave
   generator.

2. Choose one display mode (text, curses or glut) and edit load.sml.
   Default is glut.

3. Set some environment variables (CPPFLAGS, LDFLAGS, LDD, and so on)
   so that the program can find header files and libraries.
   See also samples/glut/README.

4. Run load.sml with supplying the sound stream from standard input.

Example:

First, compile sine.c.

  $ cc sine.c -o sine -lm

Then, run load.sml with piping with sine.

  $ ./sine | smlsharp load.sml
