Compiler Test Suite

 This directoy contains regression test suites and shell scripts for
running them.

There are 4 active test suites, found in the directories:

  coresml     core SML tests (based on tests from Peter Sestoft)
  modules     modules
  bugs	      bug tests
  basis	      Basis tests

Each test suite directory contains two subdirectories

  tests	      source files for tests
  outputs     corresponding output files

========================================

 The driver is in the driver directory.
To run the test, follow this procedure:

To run one test suite:
  $ cd bin/
  $ ./runtest.sh -html coresml

To run one test case:
  $ cd bin/
  $ ./runonetest.sh -html coresml abstype001.sml

If you configured SML# at a directory other than iml3/SMLSharp/, you have to specify TOP_BUILDDIR environment.
  $ env TOP_BUILDDIR=/home/yamato/iml3/SMLSharp/release ./runtest.sh ...

========================================

This test suit is originally a product of the SML/NJ developer team.
The original README document is "original_README" in this directory.
